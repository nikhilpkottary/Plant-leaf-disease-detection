# Plant-leaf-disease-detection
(Plant leaf disease detection using digital image processing technique and CNN using keras ,tensorflow and opencv).
   This project presents images preprocessing techniques and Convolution Neural Network(CNN) model for potato leaf disease detection and classification.The potato leaf dataset contains 2152 images of leaves with 2 symptoms of disease and a
healthy type.The automated detection of potato leaf disease model had achieved a training accuracy of 98% and testing accuracy of 96%.
   Image processing techniques involves smoothing,median blur,thresholding,gaussian blur and segmentation.The processed image is trained with the Convolutional Neural Network for predicting the leaf disease.A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to
various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
